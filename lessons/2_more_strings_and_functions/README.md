## README

Follow the instructions in the lesson. When you are ready to do the exercises at the end,
place the function definitions in the lesson.py file. You can test your functions by running
test.py with Python3, which has been included. It will also test the positive numbers function,
and global names. 

With the exception of positive numbers and global names, it is recommended to comment out all
code before running test.py.
